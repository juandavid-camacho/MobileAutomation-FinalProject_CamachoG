# Mobile Automation Final Project - Juan David Camacho G

### Initial Considerations
- This is the repo for the Web Automation Final Project stated in the Mobile Automation Final Practice doc.
- For the register & login tests, txt files with valid credentials were created
- All 4 tests were written in the same class file given that they are only 4, making easier to understand & debug
- A priority was assigned to each test in order for them to run in the order that they were listed on the document

> [!NOTE]
> You will have to change the config.properties location on line 17 of **BaseTest** class in ***utils***.
> You will have to change the credentialList and registeredCredentials location on line 25, 47 and 82 of **CredentialList** class in ***utils***.
